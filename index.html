			<h3>Major</h3>

				<div>
					<p>Visual Communication Design Major with a minor in Art.
					I chose this major because I enjoy using my eye for how various things are laid out and how I can make them better.
					My focus is general Graphic Design but my favorite is illustration i.e. posters, event campaigns, etc.
					My major is all about computers and the Adobe Programs and how they can work together with the designer to make something new and exciting.</p>
