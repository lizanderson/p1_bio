			<h3>Major</h3>

				<div>
					<p>Visual Communication Design Major with a minor in Art.
					I chose this major because I enjoy using my eye for how various things are laid out and how I can make them better.
					My focus is general Graphic Design but my favorite is illustration i.e. posters, event campaigns, etc.
					My major is all about computers and the Adobe Programs and how they can work together with the designer to make something new and exciting.</p>

					<p>Raised in Walla Walla, WA that is where I graduated from high school. Also where I started my college career at 16 due to Running Start. I finished my Associate's of Arts at the Community College of Aurora in Aurora, CO. After taking a year off from school I transferred into Eastern Washington University as a Junior. I'm nearly finished with my Bachelor's Degree.</p>
